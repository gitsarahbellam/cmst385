    <h3>Songs in A Minor (2001)</h3>
    <div> 
      <p class="b">SONGS IN A MINOR is the debut studio album by American singer 
      and songwriter Alicia Keys, released on June 5, 2001, by J Records.
      Keys began writing songs for the album in 1995 at age 14 and recording 
      the album in 1998 for Columbia Records, but after they rejected it, she 
      signed a recording contract with Clive Davis's Arista Records and eventually 
      J Records. An accomplished, classically trained pianist, Keys wrote, arranged 
      and produced the majority of the album herself. It is a neo soul album with 
      elements of R&B, soul, jazz, hip hop, blues, classical, and gospel music. 
      Lyrically, the songs explore the complexities and various stages of personal 
      relationships. Despite the album's title, only two songs, "Jane Doe" and "Mr. Man," 
      are actually in the key of A minor.</p>
      
      <p class="b">Songs in A Minor debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 236,000 
        copies in its first week. The album has since sold over 6.2 million copies in the 
        United States and 12 million copies worldwide. It was also an immediate critical 
        success and has since been regarded as a classic. The album earned Keys several 
        accolades, including five Grammy Awards at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. To 
        promote the album, Keys embarked on her first headlining concert tour, entitled 
        Songs in A Minor Tour.</p>
      
      <p>In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in 
        the National Recording Registry.</p>

  <p class="b"> Alicia Keys already has a lot of mystique to live up to for such a tender thing. On her debut, 
    Songs in A Minor, she was acclaimed as a soul prodigy fusing Biggie and Chopin. Keys played piano, 
    wrote the great "Fallin'," wore a cool hat and won more Grammys than she'd had hot breakfasts. But 
    success hasn't spoiled her, because she's clearly been woodshedding. The Diary of Alicia Keys is 
    an assured, adult statement, steeped in the complicated love life and musical dreams of an ambitious 
    young woman who has absorbed enough Nina Simone and Aretha Franklin records to live up to the soul 
    promise of "Harlem's Nocturne." Keys evokes Gladys Knight ("If I Was Your Woman") and Dionne Warwick 
    ("Walk On By"), but the seductive adult spell of "You Don't Know My Name" is all her own.

  <p class="b">Neo-soul, by definition, is generally “unplugged,” eschewing programmed beats, synths, and 
    samples and relying instead on old-school R&B qualities like live instrumentation and 
    old-fashioned crooning. So it’s no surprise there isn’t much difference between Alicia Keys’s 
    studio creations (as well as her other live performances) and her stint on MTV’s once-again 
    resurrected Unplugged. Grumbles that Keys’s Unplugged isn’t faithful to its namesake is even 
    sillier considering that, in the days since Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora sat on stools and 
    played “Livin’ on a Prayer” on acoustic guitars, “unplugged” has become more of a metaphorical 
    term than a literal one. And the electricity in Keys’s Unplugged is the least of its problems. 
    After a stirring a cappella intro, the set gets off to a shaky start with a medley of “Karma” and 
    “Heartburn,” two standout tracks from the singer’s sophomore effort, The Diary of Alicia Keys. 
    And talking isn’t Keys’ strong point, evidenced by her awkward interactions with the audience and 
    an uncomfortable compliment-exchange with unexpected duet partner Adam Levine of Maroon 5. By “A 
    Woman’s Worth” and the new single “Unbreakable” (with its amusing nods to “Oprah and Stedmond” and 
    “Will and Jada” and an electric bassline that strangely evokes Super Mario Bros.), Keys starts to 
    warm up, lifting her original compositions to soaring new heights, the previously unreleased “Stolen 
    Moments” and a mostly understated “Fallin’” among them. On the other hand, an abbreviated “You Don’t 
    Know My Name,” truly a producer’s creation, falls flat here, and she treats covers of Gladys Knight’s 
    “If I Was Your Woman” and “Every Little Bit Hurts” like vocal auditions and not the blank canvases of 
    an interpretive artist. It’s a talent that, perhaps, comes with time and experience, even for an artist 
    so matured in other areas. It’s in this way that Keys’s—and Unplugged’s—biggest flaw gets the big glaring 
    spotlight.
