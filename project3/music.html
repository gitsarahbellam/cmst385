    <h3>Songs in A Minor (2001)</h3>
    <div> 
      <p>SONGS IN A MINOR is the debut studio album by American singer 
      and songwriter Alicia Keys, released on June 5, 2001, by J Records.
      Keys began writing songs for the album in 1995 at age 14 and recording 
      the album in 1998 for Columbia Records, but after they rejected it, she 
      signed a recording contract with Clive Davis's Arista Records and eventually 
      J Records. An accomplished, classically trained pianist, Keys wrote, arranged 
      and produced the majority of the album herself. It is a neo soul album with 
      elements of R&B, soul, jazz, hip hop, blues, classical, and gospel music. 
      Lyrically, the songs explore the complexities and various stages of personal 
      relationships. Despite the album's title, only two songs, "Jane Doe" and "Mr. Man," 
      are actually in the key of A minor.</p>
      
      <p>Songs in A Minor debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 236,000 
        copies in its first week. The album has since sold over 6.2 million copies in the 
        United States and 12 million copies worldwide. It was also an immediate critical 
        success and has since been regarded as a classic. The album earned Keys several 
        accolades, including five Grammy Awards at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. To 
        promote the album, Keys embarked on her first headlining concert tour, entitled 
        Songs in A Minor Tour.</p>
      
      <p>In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in 
        the National Recording Registry.</p>
