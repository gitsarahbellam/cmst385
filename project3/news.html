      <p class="flex-article">Ali is a 17-year-old girl full of fire – searching for freedom, passion 
        and her place in the world. How she finds them is a New York City coming-of-age story you've never 
        felt before – HELL’S KITCHEN, a new musical from 16-time Grammy® Award 
        winner Alicia Keys, whose songs and experiences growing up in NY inspire 
        a story made for Broadway.</p>

        until she meets her mentor: a neighbor who opens her heart and mind to 
        the power of the piano. Set to the rhythm of the 90s, HELL'S KITCHEN is 
        a love story between a mother and daughter.  It's about finding yourself, 
        your purpose, and the community that lifts you. Come remember where dreams 
        begin.</p>

      <p class="flex-article">RThe “powerhouse cast” (Variety) is led by Shoshana Bean, Brandon Victor Dixon, 
        Kecia Lewis, Chris Lee, and Maleah Joi Moon. HELL’S KITCHEN is directed by 
        four-time Tony Award® nominee Michael Greif, with choreography by Tony Award 
        nominee Camille A. Brown, a book by Pulitzer Prize finalist Kristoffer Diaz – 
        and the music of Keys, featuring new songs and her greatest hits.</p>

      <p class="flex-article">In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in
