    <p>Ali is a 17-year-old girl full of fire – searching for freedom, passion 
        and her place in the world.
        How she finds them is a New York City coming-of-age story you've never 
        felt before – HELL’S KITCHEN, a new musical from 16-time Grammy® Award 
        winner Alicia Keys, whose songs and experiences growing up in NY inspire 
        a story made for Broadway.</p>
        
        <p>Rebellious and stifled by an overprotective single mother, Ali is lost 
            until she meets her mentor: a neighbor who opens her heart and mind to 
            the power of the piano. Set to the rhythm of the 90s, HELL'S KITCHEN is 
            a love story between a mother and daughter.  It's about finding yourself, 
            your purpose, and the community that lifts you. Come remember where dreams 
            begin.</p>
        
        <p>The “powerhouse cast” (Variety) is led by Shoshana Bean, Brandon Victor Dixon, 
            Kecia Lewis, Chris Lee, and Maleah Joi Moon. HELL’S KITCHEN is directed by 
            four-time Tony Award® nominee Michael Greif, with choreography by Tony Award 
            nominee Camille A. Brown, a book by Pulitzer Prize finalist Kristoffer Diaz – 
            and the music of Keys, featuring new songs and her greatest hits.
